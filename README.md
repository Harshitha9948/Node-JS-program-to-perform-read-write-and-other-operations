# Node.js File Operations Demo

This is a simple Node.js script that demonstrates basic file operations using the built-in `fs` (File System) module.

The script performs the following steps in sequence:

1. Creates and writes content to a file
2. Reads the content from the file
3. Appends additional text to the file
4. Renames the file
5. Deletes the file
